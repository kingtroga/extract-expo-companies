# extract-expo-companies
Using Python scripts, I scraped 19 Expo websites, collecting 26,453 company names. I crafted tailored Google searches to find elusive company websites. My async Python script then captured essential details: Source, Company Name, Website, Contact Name(s), Email(s), Phone Number(s), and Social Media Accounts.
